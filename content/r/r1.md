## PR's

1. [#4](https://github.com/mehmetemineker/flappy-bird/pull/4) : This was my first ever contribution to an open source project on GitHub. It is a flappy bird game where I added a title with an icon to the game(desktop based). It is written in python and uses pygame. Also update the README with the game version.
<br><br>
2. [#5](https://github.com/mehmetemineker/flappy-bird/pull/5) : I added controller support to the game, but it was for my controller(PS1). I eventually ended up closing this PR, because key mappings vary acorss different controllers.
<br><br>
3. [#111](https://github.com/SymbolicPathFinder/jpf-symbc/pull/111) : As I wanted to participate in GSoC 2025, so I polished and fixed some TODO in the Math.java file of Symbolic PathFinder. I added code that would check for `NaN` and the `+0.0` and `-0.0`. Its written in java and does symbolic execution of programs.

4. [#119](https://github.com/SymbolicPathFinder/jpf-symbc/pull/119) : My first pr while contributing to GSoC 2025, here I'm trying to support two choices null/not-null and then adding it into the listener to catch them and raise NPE.

## Conclusion

I am planning to contribute more to the **SPF** project under ***The JPF Team***, as it will help in understanding Java more and would also help me in my career ahead. Please refer to the commits and comments for more information.
